**Abstract:** We identify a critical limitation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reasoning tasks: its coarse-grained credit assignment, which propagates group-level rewards uniformly to every token in a sequence, overlooking the varying contributions of individual steps. To address this, we propose Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a mechanism that reallocates advantage based on outcome-sensitivity. We introduce two strategies: OAR-P uses counterfactual token perturbations to estimate outcome sensitivity, while OAR-G employs input-gradient sensitivity as a proxy. These signals are combined with a conservative, dual-tier advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones. Experiments show that OAR-P sets a performance ceiling, while OAR-G achieves comparable gains at negligible computational overhead, with both significantly outperforming GRPO baselines.
